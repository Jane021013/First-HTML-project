This project uses CSS and JavaScript, with many pages created using a consistent CSS layout. The main focus was on structuring the project with reusable CSS and applying it across the pages. Technically, I learned how to implement a Carousel, use Flex and Grid layouts, create window popups for styling, and handle the DOM. The project includes basic tabs such as "Login" and "Contact," where the user-entered information can be viewed through the Inspect Console. This project is a basic portfolio developed as the final project for the E-Business System Development course.
